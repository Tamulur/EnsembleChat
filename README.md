# Multi-LLM PDF Chat (Gradio)

Chat with any PDF, querying LLMs individually or let them work out a response among themselves.

_Note: this is my experiment in vibe-coding. Don't expect everything to be air-tight._

## âœ¨ Features
- **Single or multi-model replies, decide per reply** â€“ choose OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or an automatic aggregation of all three.
- **One-click controls** â€“ five fixed buttons (ChatGPT Â· Claude Â· Gemini Â· ChatGPT + Claude Â· All)
- **Quick Redo** - Leave input field empty and click a button to redo the last response
- **Aggregator logic** â€“ Claude Sonnet 4 coordinates proposer replies and may iterate up to five times before producing a final answer.
- **Cost & timeout guardrails** â€“ 120 s per request, exponential-back-off retries, and a \$5 session budget cap.
- **Lean persistence** â€“ only user inputs & final replies are stored (`Chats/`).
- **Individual model tabs** â€“ separate tabs for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini show their last outputs, including proposals that don't appear in the main chat.
- **Notification** - shows a system notification once the final answer is ready.
